EatFeed

And alas that out of frustration yet another feed aggregator is born.
I was previously using RSSOwl (despite the bloat, it worked fine), but
got broken from using a different Java vendor. Liferea never worked for
me.

EatFeed is thus a bare bones feed aggregator.

Requirements:
	curl, gtk2, and either webkit or libgtkhtml
	(including -devel packages.)

	Don't confuse libgtkhtml, aka libgtkhtml-2.0, with its sister
	library gtkhtml2, aka libgtkhtml-3.14.
	WebKit-gtk is recommended since libgtkhtml doesn't support some
	basic tags like <strike>, neither does utf-8 charset.

Hidden features:

	o --hide option: useful for a startup launch. (check --help for
	  more options).

	o you can subscribe to a feed from Firefox. Since we don't lock
	  the program into a single instance however, you should exit any
	  running instance before subscribing from the browser.

	o besides the visible "add feed" button, you may edit the feeds
	  bar by pressing right-click to remove, double-click to edit label,
	  and drag-and-drop to better position them.

	o feeds will be refreshed every 30 mins. The icon gets brighter when
	  unread news are available and blinks for a seconds as news arrive.
